# UFOs

**Project Overview**

Th aim of this project is to create a tidy and easy to use HTML webpage that will have information about UFO sightings. To achieve that we needed to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Then created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it reacts to user input, and then the table was placed into an HTML file for easy viewing.
 The webpage was customized using Bootstrap, which helped to get the table with several fully functional filters that allows users to interact with it.

**Results**

UFO webpage visitors can use search criteria to view different results based on their preferences or what information they are trying to find. During the filtering process user can use all filters together or one or two.

Summary

- One drawback of this webpage is how the filters works, which my word input. If the user is not familiar enough with topic and page content, it would make it hard to inter the right input.
- This drawback leads to a potential future development, as adding a drop menu for the filters, this way the users have list of options to choose from.
- The page can use some features to make it more user friendly such as a bottom to take you up the page, so you don&#39;t have to scroll all way up. Maybe sharing bottoms to different social media platform so user can easily shar interesting finding with friends.
